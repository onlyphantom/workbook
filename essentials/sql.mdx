## Introduction

Much of the data we work with in the financial industry is stored in databases and accessed using SQL. 

To really unlock the power of data, your ability and general familiarity with SQL will be a huge 
advantage in your career, and is the reason why it's often a requirement for many data-related roles.

This module will cover the theoretical and practical aspects of database management and the querying language SQL.
If you do not have a database connection set up (as is expected for most learners and beginners), the best alternative is to use SQLite, which is a lightweight database engine that can be used without a server.

Follow the instructions in the [Recommended Pre-Reading](#recommended-pre-reading) section above to set up a SQLite database from a CSV file.
If you're following this module as part of a course, you will be required to complete 
that setup to be able to follow along with the lessons.

<Tip>
  For the most part, you will also need a database client to interact with your database. These ranged from 
  full fledged workbenches, to simple command line tools. I am using the `SQLite` VSCode 
  extension by alexcvzz, which suffice for the purpose of this module.
</Tip>

## Connecting to a Database
Very often, to make a connection to a database, you will need to provide a connection string and 
use a library to help with the connection. Among the most popular choices for Python users would be 
`sqlalchemy` ([additional lessons to SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/onlyphantom/sqlalchemy-tutorial)) 
which acts as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), but there are also libraries specific to the database:

- PostgreSQL: `psycopg2`
- MySQL: `mysql-connector-python` or `mysqlclient`

In addition to an ORM or an adapter library, you would also need to prepare the connection details
for the database. This would include the database name, the user, the password, and the host. 

Depending on the tools you use, I've provided a list of examples below to help you make the first 
connection to a database and perform a simple query.

## Database queries with Pandas
SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

<Card icon="notebook" title="Notebook Exercise" href="https://github.com/onlyphantom/dataanalysis/blob/master/4_SQL_Query.ipynb">
  Looking for some structured practice with using SQL directly in Pandas? 

  Try your hands on the exercises in [4_SQL_Query](https://github.com/onlyphantom/dataanalysis/blob/master/4_SQL_Query.ipynb) before moving into 
  the lab exercises below.
</Card>

## <Icon icon="flask"/> Lab 
All of the following exercise is to be performed on the `sqlite` database you created from the CSV files:

- `metadata` table: from `idx_subsector_metadata_080824.csv`
- `reports` table: from `idx_sector_reports_080824.csv`
- the database itself should be called `sectors.db`

Your submission should be a folder with all the SQL files you created for each exercise.

### Renaming columns with `ALTER TABLE` and `RENAME COLUMN`

Let's start off simple. Create a file and name it `01_rename.sql`. Use `ALTER TABLE <table_name> RENAME COLUMN <existing_name> TO <new_name>` to make alterations to the column in `metadata`
named `sub_sector_id`. Rename it to `sub_sector_uid`.  

<Tip>
  If you use the VSCode extension, you can also run the query directly to verify that 
  your answer is correct.

  1. CTRL + SHIFT + P to open the command palette
  2. Type `SQLite: New Query`
  3. Type in your query
  4. CTRL + SHIFT + P + `SQLite: Run Query` or use the shortcut (CTRL + SHIFT + Q)

  You may need to refresh your database view to see this change take effect. Alternatively, you can 
  also use `PRAGMA table_info(metadata);` to see the column names.
</Tip>

### `SELECT`, `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` in queries

Now create a second file and call it `02_select.sql`. 

Use `SELECT` to query the `reports` table and return the first 10 rows with the following columns:
- `sub_sector`
- `total_companies`
- `filtered_median_pe`

Add an `OFFSET` clause to your query to get the first 10 rows after the first 5 rows (skipping the first 5 rows).

```sql
SELECT _, _, _
FROM reports
LIMIT _
OFFSET _;
```

### Return unique values with `DISTINCT` and `as` aliasing 

Create a third file and name it `03_distinct.sql`.

Use `SELECT` to query the `metadata` table and return the first 10 unique sectors in the table.

Add a `DISTINCT` clause to your query to return only unique values in the 
`sector` column. This will remove any duplicate values from the result set.

Name the column `Indonesian Sectors` using the `AS` keyword.

```sql
SELECT column AS column_name
# or:
SELECT column AS "column name"
```

Use a `LIMIT` clause to return only the first 10 rows.

### Filtering data with `WHERE`

Create a fourth file and name it `04_where.sql`.

From the `reports` table, select only rows where the sub-sector has 
at least 15 companies and the average market cap of that sector (`avg_market_cap`) is lesser than 500_000_000_000 ("500 billion").

Return the following columns:
- `sub_sector`
- `total_companies`
- `avg_market_cap`

You can join multiple conditions using the `AND` keyword.

```sql
SELECT _, _, _
FROM _
WHERE _ >= _ AND _ < _;
```

### Pattern matching with `LIKE`.

Create a fifth file and name it `05_like.sql`.

In SQL, you can use wildcards for constructing patterns. 

- `%` wildcard matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
- `_` wildcard matches any single character.
- `b%` matches `bank`, `bytes`, `bit`
- `%ion` matches `institution`, `renovation`
- `%it% matches any string containing `it`

- `b_nk` matches `bank`, `bunk`
- `l__n` matches `loan`, `lean`

"A" LIKE "a" is true (non case sensitive). To set it to 
case sensitive, run `PRAGMA case_sensitive_like = true`;

Select all rows from the `metadata` table where the `sub_sector` column contains the word `Goods` or `Services` (both case insensitive), 
regardless of the position of these words in the string.

Return all columns.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM __
WHERE sub_sector LIKE '__' OR sub_sector LIKE '__';
```

### Joining tables with `LEFT JOIN`
Create a sixth file and name it `06_left_join.sql`.

Use a `LEFT JOIN` to join the `metadata` and `reports` tables on the `sub_sector` column.

Return the following columns:
- `sector`
- `sub_sector`
- `total_companies`
- `avg_market_cap`

```sql
SELECT _, m.sub_sector, _, _
FROM metadata AS m
LEFT JOIN reports AS r
ON _ = _;
```

### Aggregation and grouping with `GROUP BY`

Create a seventh file and name it `07_group_by.sql`. 

This file should contain two queries.

For the first query, use `COUNT` to return the number of rows in each group 
of `sector` in the `metadata` table. This gives us an idea of how many sub sectors
are in each sector.

Name the columns `sector` and `total_sub_sectors`.
```sql
SELECT _, COUNT(*) as _
FROM _
GROUP BY _;
```

For the second query, use `AVG` to return the average number of companies of each sub sector by 
grouping on the `sector` column.

Name the columns `sector`, `sub_sector`, `total_companies`, and `avg_sub_sector_companies`.

This query should be similar to the one in your `LEFT JOIN` exercise 
since you will need to join the two tables to get the `total_companies` column.

```sql
SELECT sector, AVG(total_companies) AS _
FROM _
LEFT JOIN _
ON _
GROUP BY sector;
```

### Using `CAST AS` and `ORDER BY`
Since aggregation is commonly applied on numeric columns, this may present a little bit of problem when our columns are in character strings. You may alter the database table and change the column types, or you may use `CAST AS` to cast the column values from character to either `integer` or `decimal`.

Create an eighth file and name it `08_cast_as.sql`.

Use `CAST AS` to change the `total_companies` and `avg_market_cap` columns in the `reports` table to an integer.
Finally, use `ORDER BY` to sort the result set by the `total_companies` column in descending order. Return 
only the first ten rows and the following columns:
- `sub_sector`
- `total_companies` as companies_num
- `avg_market_cap` as market_cap_average

```sql
SELECT _, 
  CAST(_) AS _, 
  CAST(AS integer) AS _
FROM reports
ORDER BY _ DESC
LIMIT _;
```

For practice's sake, you should also try this exercise without 
changing the column types and see if you can get the same result 
when ordering by a character column. 

If you get the following results, you did not cast the columns correctly:

```plaintext
|sub_sector|total_companies|avg_market_cap|
|---|---|---|
|sub_sector_1|97|1000000000|
|sub_sector_2|92|500000000|
|sub_sector_3|9|250000000|
|sub_sector_4|85|100000000|
```

### Using `HAVING TO` to filter grouped data
`HAVING` has to be used with `GROUP BY`. They act similarly to how `WHERE` works on rows, except `HAVING` filters on the group levels.

Create a ninth file and name it `09_having.sql`.

Perform the second exercise in the seventh file again, but this 
time return only sectors where the `avg_sub_sector_companies` is greater than 30.

### Use a subquery to nest a `SELECT` under another

Subqueries allow you to put together more complex queries while maintaining some readability. Fundamentally, a subquery is just a nested level of `SELECT` statement. 

Create a tenth file and name it `10_subquery.sql`.

First create a subquery that returns all rows from `metadata` where the sector is either `Financials` or `Technology` (case-sensitive!). 

Then use this subquery to filter the `reports` table, so the returned set 
only contains rows where the `sub_sector` is in the (earlier) subquery result.

Return the following columns in your query:
- `sub_sector`
- `min_company_pe`
- `max_company_pe`

```sql
SELECT sub_sector, min_company_pe, max_company_pe
FROM _
WHERE _ IN (
    SELECT sub_sector 
    FROM _
    WHERE _ IN ('_', '_')
)
```

### Using `BETWEEN` to filter data within a range

Create a eleventh file and name it `11_between.sql`.

Your query should be similar to the one in the tenth file above, 
with a small adjustment. 

- In your subquery (the inner query), return all rows from `metadata` where the `sector` is either `Financials` or `Infrastructures` and when the `sub_sector_uid` is between 3 and 20. 
- In your outer query, return only rows where the `avg_yoy_q_revenue_growth` is between 0 and 0.3.

Note that `BETWEEN` is inclusive on both ends, so `BETWEEN 0 AND 17` includes 0 and 17.

Return the following columns:
- `sub_sector`
- `avg_yoy_q_revenue_growth`
- `min_company_pe`
- `max_company_pe`

Notice that:
- If you have performed the exercises earlier, your column names may have be altered. We're working with the 
`sub_sector_uid` column after the renaming exercise.
- `BETWEEN`, as you'd expect, expect two values separated by `AND` and that these are 
numbers or dates. You might have to cast the column to a number if it's not already.

```sql
SELECT sub_sector, avg_yoy_q_revenue_growth, min_company_pe, max_company_pe
FROM _ 
WHERE _ IN (
    SELECT _ 
    FROM _
    WHERE _ IN ('Financials', 'Infrastructures')
    AND _ BETWEEN _ AND _
) AND avg_yoy_q_revenue_growth BETWEEN _;
```

### Using `CREATE VIEW` to pack a query into a named object
For the final exercise, create a file and name it `12_create_view.sql`.

A view is the result set of a stored query. It is a virtual table you define
in the database that can be queried like a table, except that it 
does not store data. 

Once you have defined a view, you can query it like a table -- it can include 
columns from any number of tables, involving complex joins, filters and 
aggregations. 

We create a view with the `CREATE VIEW` statement.

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
```

In your file, create a view named `watchlist` from `reports` where the following conditions are met:
- `avg_market_cap` is greater than the average of `avg_market_cap`. This means we're only watching 
sectors with companies that are generally larger than the average.
- `avg_yoy_q_revenue_growth` is greater than 0.1. This narrow our watchlist to sectors with companies 
that are growing at a rate of at least 10% year-on-year.
- `median_yield_ttm` greater than 0.03. This further narrows our watchlist to sectors with companies
that are, on average, paying out at least 3% worth of dividiend yield.

Return all columns. You may need to perform type casting to ensure
that the columns are of the correct type.

```sql
CREATE VIEW watchlist AS
SELECT *
FROM reports
-- complete the query here
-- ... 
```

Now, use `PRAGMA` to print out the columns of the `watchlist` view.

```sql
PRAGMA table_info(watchlist);
```

Depending on your database editor or application, you may need to refresh the explorer to see your views being created.

You can now attempt a query directly on this view to see if it works as expected.

```sql
SELECT * FROM watchlist LIMIT 10;
```


#### Benefits and Advantages of Views
Views present the following benefits:
- Simplify complex queries: Views can encapsulate complex queries and present a simplified, more understandable interface. Users can query the view without needing to know the details of the underlying tables and joins.
- Data security: Views can restrict access to sensitive data. By creating views that only include certain columns or rows, you can control what data users see and access.
- Consistency: Views ensure consistent results for complex queries. If you have a commonly used query, encapsulating it in a view ensures that any changes to the query logic are applied uniformly across all users and applications accessing that view.
- Abstraction: Views abstract the underlying database schema. If the schema changes, you can often adjust the view without modifying the application code that uses the view.
- Maintainaibility: If you need to update how data is presented or aggregated, you can modify the view definition without changing the application code that uses it.
- Materialized views: Some databases support materialized views, which store the results of the view query in a table-like structure. This can improve query performance by pre-computing the results and storing them for faster access. In cases where 
materialized view isn't supported, you can create a table from the view. It is important to distinguish this from regular views, which are 
virtual and are generally just queries that are run when the view is queried.
